    <h3>First Glance</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Maxine, and I'm currently attending the Girls Who Code
      Summer Immersion Program (SIP). I was introduced to the program through
      my computer programming teacher at school.
    </p>
    <p>At first, I didn't like coding. I thought it tedious and redundant. I'm
      glad to be proven wrong - HTML was the first language I learned, and I
      still don't like it, but languages like C++ and Python are more
      appealing to me.

    <h3>Likes and Dislikes</h3>
    <p>I'm a picky person, if I'm being honest. I dislike both honey and mustard,
      but find honey mustard to be one of the best condiments known to man. I
      love cucumbers, but pickles are an abomination. I detest school, but enjoy
      learning. Here are a few of my likes and dislikes:
      <div class = "row">
        <div class = "column">
          <h4>Likes</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Cats</li>
            <li>Superhero movies</li>
            <li>Skiing</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class = "column">
          <h4>Dislikes</h4>
